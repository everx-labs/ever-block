# ton-types repository changelog
## Version 2.0.40

- Added wrappers for BLS arithmetic

## Version 2.0.39

- Remove debug prints for BLS

## Version 2.0.38

- Minor optimization for fn SliceData::get_bytestring

## Version 2.0.37

- Renamed `TON` into `ever` in comments

## Version 2.0.36

- Added `BocReader::set_allow_big_cells` method
- Supported big cell data serialization in `CellData::serialize` & `CellData::deserialize` 
  (the functions are not used in boc, they need in node)

## Version 2.0.35

- The code related to cell counting was covered by the `cell_counter` feature.
  Disable counting allows to increase cell's synthetic performance, 
  but the counting is very needed for memory usage diagnostics.

## Version 2.0.15

- BocWriter::write_ex(): do not compute CRC if not requested

## Version 2.0.14

- Fixed cells lifetime while BOC traverse

## Version 2.0.13

- Added UsageTree::build_visited_set

## Version 2.0.12

- Refactor LabelReader for perfomance
- Use load_bitstring for performance

## Version 2.0.11

## Version 2.0.9

- Optimize Cell::default()

## Version 2.0.8

- Fixed bug in hashmap_filter function

## Version 2.0.7

- Fixed panics after fuzzing

## Version 2.0.6

- Added wrappers for sha256, sha512, base64
- Bumped version of crc crate to 3.0
- Fix for clippy

## Version 2.0.0
- Added big cell. Call `create_big_cell` to create one.
- BOC routines: supported big cells and refactoring. 
  Created two basic structs for in-depth working with BOC: `BocWriter` and `BocReader`.
  Additionally three convinient wrappers: `write_boc`, `read_boc` and `read_single_root_boc`, that you'll probably want to use.

## Version: 1.12.2
- Fix for clippy

## Version: 1.12.1
- Add common as submodule

## Version: 1.12.0
- Remove bad types conversion

## Version: 1.11.11

### Bugfixes
- Loading cells with checking cell type

## Version: 1.11.3

### Bugfixes

- Fixed bug in 'deserialize_cells_tree_inmem_with_abort' - deleted unneded check with error (all needed checks performs in 'precheck_cells_tree_len'). Error appeared when BOC contained CRC.
- Fixed bug in 'deserialize_cells_tree_inmem_with_abort' - CRC calculated using wrong offsets.
